## 🎁 BONUS: Talking Points for Investors

Use these when discussing GTIXT positioning:

1. **"Standards before regulation"**
   - Market timing is critical (2025-2026)
   - First-movers define the standard
   - Standards then become baseline

2. **"Institutional grade from day 1"**
   - Cryptographic integrity (SHA-256)
   - Version control (full audit trail)  
   - Deterministic methodology (reproducible)

3. **"Neutral, transparent, auditable"**
   - No conflicts of interest
   - Pricing public, evidence public
   - Community can verify

4. **"Market consolidation creates demand"**
   - 50-70% of current firms will exit 2026+
   - Survivors = institutional-quality
   - GTIXT helps identify survivors
